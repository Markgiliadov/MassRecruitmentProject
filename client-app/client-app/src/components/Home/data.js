    info: "After the Kickstarter project closes, and after all pledges are collected, we will open the BackerKit pledge manager. There, you will provide your physical address and pay for shipping (if you are receiving physical rewards). If you are in the United States, then you will also have the chance to add more items to your rewards package. See the FAQ for estimated shipping costs. Add-ons are not available to international backers.Failure to complete your BackerKit survey by the deadline (which will be announced in a Kickstarter update once the pledge manager opens) will result in a refund and removal from the project. We cannot allow projects to remain open forever; we must set firm deadlines so that we can properly close campaigns.If you wish, you may choose to use a fulfillment service. This allows you to pledge for the project and then provide us with a U.S. address for the delivery of your rewards. Forwarding from the fulfillment service, as well as any local fees, is your responsibility when using a fulfillment company.",
